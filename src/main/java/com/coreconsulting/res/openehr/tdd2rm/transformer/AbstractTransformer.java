/**
 * This class abstracts the concept of a transformer that is capable of transforming a TDD element of a specific
 * type, making it compliant to the openEHR Reference Model.
 * Every concrete subclass is expected to override this, providing the supported {@link #type} and a specific
 * {@link #transformElement(TDD, Element, String, String, StringBuilder)}, depending on the adjustments identified
 * through the gap between th TDD and the openEHR Reference Model for the type.
 * This is the major extensibility point of the application. Once a new concrete implementation is added, it has to
 * be registered through the {@link TransformerFactory} for it to be recognized by {@link TDD#transformNode(Node, StringBuilder)}.
